Original Description: |

  GWL3 Part 1 - I wanted to name this one after a Talking Heads album so I could have Hayley dancing in a big suit on the main menu.

  Hayley's back! And her quest to make it in the world of Professional Wrestling continues! What crazy situations await our spunky blonde haired heroine?... Probably ones that involve getting spunk in her hair, because once again, this is a porn series with porn in it.

  If you want to help fund future games/animations/art, head on over to my Patreon, I really appreciate all the support and it lets me add more content into each project :3 Also sometimes I buy food and that helps keep me alive.

  Supporters get early access to demos and animated sex scenes! As well as previews of art. There's even an option to vote on which characters and scenes you want to see in future games :3 Oh and a chance to have one of your characters feature in a game!

  https://www.patreon.com/hayleypetharley
